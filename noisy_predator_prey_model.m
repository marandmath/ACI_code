% Code corresponding to the noisy predator-prey model in Section SI.4.2 - "A 
% Noisy Predator-Prey Model" of the paper "Assimilative Causal Inference".
%
% Authors: Marios Andreou, Nan Chen, Erik Bollt.
%
% Code Information: Application of Assimilative Causal Inference (ACI) to a 
% noisy version of the predator-prey (Lotka-Volterra) model with intermittent 
% regime switches:
%
%       (Predator Population) dx/dt = βxy - αx + σ_x·dot(W)_x,
%       (Prey Population) dy/dt = γy - δxy + σ_y·dot(W)_y.
%
% This is a stochastic conceptual model explaining the cyclical fluctuations 
% between the populations of species like lynx and hares. x is the population 
% density of a predator species, while y that of its prey. Their time 
% derivatives describe their instantaneous population growth rates, α is the 
% predator's natural death rate, β quantifies how prey availability enhances 
% predator growth, γ is the maximum intrinsic growth rate of prey, and δ 
% captures the negative impact of predators on the prey population. Here, since 
% β,δ>0, larger prey population y (y > α/β) enhances x via antidamping 
% mechanisms, while a larger predator population x (x < γ/δ) naturally
% intensifies the damping in y. The resulting coupled variations in x and y
% produce intermittent phase alternations and causal regime switches over time 
% t∈[0,T], from y(t) → x to x(t) → y and vice versa.  ACI is employed to study
% both causal relationships, therefore both x and y are assumed to be 
% observable variables. Since this model is a conditional Gaussian nonlinear 
% system (CGNS) both for x|y and y|x, then both of these posterior distributions 
% (filter and smoother) are Gaussian. This code uses the same parameter values 
% as those cited in the paper.
